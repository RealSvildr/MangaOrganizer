# MangaOrganizer - v2.2

> What it does
 * Rename all folders and subfolders to match the chapter number
   * E.g.: hardcore_leveling_warrior -> Hardcore Leveling Warrior ||  hardcore_leveling_warrior_52 -> 052
 * Rename images for the page number (same idea as the first one)
 * Generate a html file reader to make it more easy to read the anime.


> TODO List
- [ ] Descompact Winrar + Delete Winrar
